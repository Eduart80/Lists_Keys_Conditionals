This application is a task management tool, like a to do list, designed to help users organize and prioritize their tasks effectively. It allows users to:

- Update the status of tasks using a dropdown menu.
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed.

The app is built using React and styled with Bootstrap for a clean and responsive user interface. It demonstrates the use of React components, props, state management, and conditional rendering.
